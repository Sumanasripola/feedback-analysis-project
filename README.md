# feedback-analysis-project
This project delivers a powerful machine learning-based system for Feedback Authenticity Detection and Sentiment Analysis, built on a Flask backend. It automates the classification of user feedback as either genuine or false, and detects its sentimentâ€”positive, negative, or neutral.
Feedback Authenticity & Sentiment Analysis Backend
An AI-powered Flask backend system designed to classify textual feedback for authenticity (genuine vs. false) and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). This project provides a robust API for real-time analysis, batch processing, model retraining, and generating insightful analytics reports.

Features
Real-time Prediction: Analyze individual feedback texts for authenticity and sentiment instantly.
Batch Analysis: Process multiple feedback entries simultaneously by uploading a CSV file.
Model Retraining: Dynamically retrain the authenticity and sentiment models with new or updated data to improve performance.
Analytics Reports: Generate comprehensive reports including authenticity distribution, sentiment breakdown, frequent keywords, and word clouds for genuine feedback.
Data Persistence: Automatically saves new feedback and predictions to a CSV dataset, allowing continuous learning and analysis.
Robust Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, stop-word removal, and stemming for effective NLP.
Algorithms Used
This project leverages the following machine learning algorithms and techniques:
TF-IDF Vectorization (TfidfVectorizer): Converts text data into numerical feature vectors, weighting words based on their importance in a document and across the corpus.
Authenticity Model (SGDClassifier): A linear classifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent) trained to distinguish between genuine and false feedback. It's efficient for large-scale text classification.
Sentiment Model (LogisticRegression): A linear model used for multi-class classification to categorize feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Flask: Web framework for building the API.
Flask-CORS: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend integration.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (for CSV handling).
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for TF-IDF, SGDClassifier, and LogisticRegression.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming).
Joblib: For efficient saving and loading of Python objects (models, vectorizer).
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating visualizations (e.g., word clouds).
WordCloud: Library for creating word cloud images.
Node.js & npm: (Assumed for frontend development, typically with React, Vue, or Angular)
Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>


Create a virtual environment for the backend (recommended):
python -m venv venv


Activate the backend virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate


On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Install backend dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

(If requirements.txt is not provided, you can create one with pip freeze > requirements.txt after manually installing the listed dependencies, or simply install them one by one: pip install Flask Flask-Cors pandas scikit-learn nltk joblib matplotlib seaborn wordcloud)
Download NLTK data:
The application will attempt to download stopwords and punkt automatically on first run if not found. If you encounter issues, you can manually download them:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')


Usage
Running the Backend
Assuming your backend code (app.py) is located in a directory named backend at the root of your project:
Ensure your backend virtual environment is activated.
Navigate into the backend directory:
cd backend


Run the Flask backend server:
python app.py

The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or http://localhost:5000).
Upon the first run, the application will automatically create a data folder with a feedback_data.csv (if it doesn't exist) and train the machine learning models, saving them in the models folder. This might take a moment.
Subsequent runs will load the saved models, which is much faster.
Running the Frontend
Assuming your frontend code is located in a directory named frontend at the root of your project:
Navigate into the frontend directory:
cd frontend


Install frontend dependencies (if you haven't already):
npm install


Start the frontend development server:
npm run dev

This command will typically start a development server (e.g., on http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173, depending on the frontend framework) and open the application in your browser.
Interacting with the API
You can use tools like Postman, curl, or integrate with your running frontend application to send requests to the API endpoints.
API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following API endpoints:
1. /status (GET)
Description: Checks if the backend server is running.
Response:
{
  "status": "online"
}


2. /predict (POST)
Description: Analyzes feedback text for authenticity and sentiment. Supports single text input or batch CSV file upload.
Request Body (Single Text):
{
  "feedback_text": "This product is amazing and works perfectly!"
}


Request Body (CSV File Upload):
Send a multipart/form-data request with a file field named file.
The CSV file must contain a column named feedback_text. It can optionally contain is_fake and sentiment columns for initial data.
Example test.csv content:
feedback_text
"This is a great product."
"Terrible experience, very slow delivery."
"Limited time offer! Buy now!"


Response (Single Text):
{
  "feedback_text": "This product is amazing and works perfectly!",
  "authenticity": "Genuine",
  "authenticity_confidence": 0.98,
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "sentiment_confidence": 0.95
}


Response (Batch CSV):
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "feedback_text": "This is a great product.",
      "authenticity": "Genuine",
      "authenticity_confidence": 0.97,
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "sentiment_confidence": 0.93
    },
    // ... more predictions
  ],

Data Format
The core dataset for this project is feedback_data.csv, located in the data/ directory. It should have the following columns:
feedback_text: (String) The actual text content of the feedback.
is_fake: (String) Label indicating authenticity. Expected values: "yes" or "no".
sentiment: (String) Label indicating sentiment. Expected values: "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
Example feedback_data.csv entry:
feedback_text,is_fake,sentiment
